# Aerial-Defence-Dashboard
FalconOps is a JavaFX-based air defense simulation that mimics a radar control system. It detects incoming aircraft blips, verifies their authorization using a connected MySQL database, and triggers visual and audio alerts based on the result. The simulation includes real-time radar sweep, dynamic blip animations, immersive pop-up alerts, and sound effects to create a command-center-like experience.

Key Features:
Real-time radar sweep and blip detection
Aircraft ID verification via MySQL
Visual indicators for authorized/unauthorized aircraft
Buzzer and voice alerts for unauthorized entries
Modular code design using Java, JavaFX, and JDBC
